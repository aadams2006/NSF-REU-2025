"""
This script trains a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, specifically using LSTM layers,
to predict multiple target variables from sequential fiber data. It includes data
preprocessing, model definition, training, evaluation, and saving of the trained
model and scalers.

The script performs the following steps:
1.  **Configuration**: Sets up paths for data, models, and reports, and defines
    model-specific parameters.
2.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Reads the combined fiber data, groups it
    by specimen, and resamples each specimen's data to a fixed length. It then
    splits each specimen's data into input (features) and output (targets) sequences.
3.  **Data Scaling**: Applies Min-Max scaling to both input features and output
    targets to normalize the data for optimal model training.
4.  **Model Definition**: Constructs an LSTM-based RNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
    The model is designed for sequence-to-sequence prediction, taking a sequence
    of features and outputting a sequence of target values.
5.  **Model Training**: Compiles and trains the RNN model on the prepared and
    scaled training data.
6.  **Model Saving**: Saves the trained RNN model and the fitted scalers (for
    features and targets) to disk for later use in prediction.
7.  **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the trained model's performance on a held-out
    test set using the R-squared metric.
8.  **Reporting**: Generates and saves an evaluation report with key metrics and
    preprocessing parameters.
